# VenueHireSystem

Using Object Oriented Programming principles a venue hire system is created.
Venue hire systems can be complex. In this project, I designed and implemented a simple venue hire system capable of storing information about venues and their bookings.

This system is designed for use by the venue hire company to manage their venues and bookings. The venue hire company’s staff can use this system to:

View details of all the venues
Create new venues
View details of all the bookings for a venue
Create new bookings for a venue
Add catering, music, and floral services to a booking
View the invoice for a booking
Due to the venue hire company’s limited budget (it’s apparently tough being a venue hire company), this system features a terminal-driven interface. The system is controlled through a menu displayed on the terminal. The staff member can select from a list of commands by typing its code and any expected arguments. Some commands require additional options, which are prompted by the system one at a time. The system then executes the appropriate action.
